Ludum Dare 46 - Keep It Alive

## Premise

You're the mommy dragon! Move your head up and down and aim your fireballs at the incoming baddies - one fireball turns a baddie into delicious meat for your babies, but a second fireball will turn them into ash. The babies are hungry, so make sure they get as much meat as possible so they don't starve before they can grow up big and strong.
